!!! **WIP** !!! experimental library to support project **logreplay** !!! **WIP**!!!

A go library that handles pooling of co-routines.

1. You define the Worker logic
2. You define the logic to process worker results
3. You pass some *Work* into the WorkerPool

WorkerPool encapsulates creation and control of co-routines.


**I'm not sure if this use case satisfies a 'library'.**
